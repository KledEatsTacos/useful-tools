# 🛑[SuperF4](https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4/)
SuperF4 kills the foreground program when you press Ctrl+Alt+F4. This is different from when you press Alt+F4. When you press Alt+F4, the program can refuse to quit. Windows only asks the program to quit, and lets it decide for itself what to do.

You can also kill a program by pressing Win+F4 and then clicking the window with your mouse cursor. You can press escape or the right mouse button to exit this mode without killing a program.

## ⚙️Installation 
Download the installer [here](https://github.com/stefansundin/superf4/releases/download/v1.4/SuperF4-1.4.exe).

While installing, you will come across this:

![Installation example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cabc930-2280-4116-880b-f346139a1e8a)

I highly recommend enabling registry tweak to prevent any funny stuff from happening to SuperF4.

Once the program is installed, right-click on its icon. I recommend turning on the autostart and elevate on autostart options, as they will let the program start on bootup and give the program higher privileges, as it may not be able to close certain programs without them.
